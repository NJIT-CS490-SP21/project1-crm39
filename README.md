# Project Name TBD
This usually takes me a while

## Technical Issues

My biggest roadblock was parsing the json returned by the Spotify API. It was confusing 
to see so many elements nested in dictionaries and lists. I used [CodeBeautify's](https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer)
 jsonviewer to help better visualize the json element and get the necessary values

## Known problems

None, at the moment

## Improvements
- I will allow the user to search for the artist
- Create logic to remove the audio player if there is no preview_url provided for the song
- Style the image to improve it's looks (rounded corners, increase size, etc)
